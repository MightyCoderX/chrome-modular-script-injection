# Chrome Extension Modular Script Injection
Automatically injects modules defined in module-loader array into page as ES6 modules, depending on the current URL path. 
Which is convenient when making extensions for SPAs where a module is loaded on it's matching path!

### TODO
- [ ] Implement path change detection with history proxy
